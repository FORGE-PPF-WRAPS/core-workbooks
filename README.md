## Build & Print

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Google Chrome (for PDF generation)

### Install & Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # HTML output
npm run build:pdf    # HTML + PDF output
```

Output files land in `workbooks/output/`:

- `window-tint-workbook.html` / `.pdf`
- `ppf-workbook.html` / `.pdf`

### Print from Browser

Open any `.html` file in Chrome and use **Print → Save as PDF** or send to a printer. The stylesheet is optimized for US Letter paper.

## Workbook Structure

Each core course follows the same 3-day format:

1. **Day 1 — Foundations** — Film science, tools, safety, prep, first installs
2. **Day 2 — Technique** — Shrinking/stretching, complex panels, troubleshooting
3. **Day 3 — Professional Practice** — Capstone install, QC, business basics, assessment

Every workbook includes:

- Pre-course checklist
- Daily schedules and learning objectives
- Classroom sessions with reference tables
- Hands-on lab exercises with instructor sign-off
- Knowledge checks
- Notes pages
- Course completion record

## Editing

Source files are Markdown in `workbooks/core/<course>/workbook.md`. Edit the Markdown, then rebuild. HTML div classes (`callout`, `lab`, `knowledge-check`, etc.) pass through for print styling.
